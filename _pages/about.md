Hi :)

About me
======
I am a meteorologist, with extensive experience in air pollution, atmospheric and climate sciences. I am dedicated to applying scientific research to develop impactful solutions for sustainable living. 

I graduated from the University of Hormozgan, Iran. My Ph.D. dissertation, under the guidance of Prof. [Hossein Malakooti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FVVKDnkAAAAJ&hl=en), which received a grade of 19.90/20, encompassed several key projects. I conducted an in-depth analysis of factors influencing NOx concentration during high pollution episodes in Tehran Metropolitan using the WRF-Chem model. Given Tehran’s complex topography, the study provided valuable insights into the city’s intricate environmental and atmospheric dynamics. I also applied the WRF-Chem model to study the wet/ dry deposition of NO2 and SO2 in West Asia. Additionally, I explored the exchange of CO2 over West Asia using Earth System Models from CMIP6 and observation-based data, investigating the impact of atmospheric and marine conditions on CO2 exchange.

I also received my Master’s degree in Meteorology in 2019. My Master’s thesis, titled "<i>Study of low-level wind field over Qeshm Island using the WRF model</i>" involved analyzing wind patterns to evaluate the potential for wind energy, in the region. These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in atmospheric modeling, data analysis, and research methodologies. Please see [Research tab](https://monazarghamipour.github.io/research/) for more details about my research background.

I aim to pursue the following goals with a dedicated focus on <i>enhancing our society's resilience and adaptability in the face of a changing climate</i>:

1. **Studying Air Pollution and Climate Change:** Utilizing a combination of observational data and numerical models to enhance our understanding of air pollution and climate change.

2. **Applying Machine Learning in Meteorology:** Although I have not yet had the opportunity to work extensively with machine learning in meteorology, I have pursued courses to build a foundational understanding of this exciting field. I am particularly interested in how machine learning can enhance numerical weather prediction, and to apply in meteorological studies.

3. **Studying Tropical Cyclones:** Conducting in-depth research on tropical cyclones to better predict and mitigate their impacts on affected regions.
