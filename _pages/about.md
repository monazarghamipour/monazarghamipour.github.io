Hi :)

Welcome to my academic website.

About me
======
I am a meteorologist, with extensive experience in atmospheric and climate sciences. Dedicated to applying scientific research to develop impactful solutions for sustainable living. 

I graduated from the University of Hormozgan, Iran. My Ph.D. dissertation, under the guidance of Prof. Hossein Malakooti, which received a grade of 19.90/20, encompassed several key projects. I conducted an in-depth analysis of factors influencing NOx concentration during high pollution episodes in Tehran Metropolitan using the WRF-Chem model. Given Tehran’s complex topography, the study provided valuable insights into the city’s intricate environmental and atmospheric dynamics. I also applied the WRF-Chem model to study the wet/ dry deposition of NO2 and SO2 in West Asia. Additionally, I explored the exchange of CO2 over West Asia using Earth System Models from CMIP6 and observation-based data, investigating the impact of atmospheric and marine conditions on CO2 exchange.

I also received my Master’s degree in Meteorology in 2019. My Master’s thesis, titled "Study of low-level wind field over Qeshm Island using the WRF model" involved analyzing wind patterns to evaluate the potential for wind energy, in the region. These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in atmospheric modeling, data analysis, and research methodologies.
